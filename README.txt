For first time users of bipolar stepper motors, when the system is all hooked up and powered, never
disconnect the coil wires that belong to the motor from the board until all power sources are removed.
There is a chance that the resulting feedback from the magnetic coils will damage your stepper driver board.

Rotational limits to the motor are determined based on how many steps are in your stepper motor which
can be found on product description pages generally.
